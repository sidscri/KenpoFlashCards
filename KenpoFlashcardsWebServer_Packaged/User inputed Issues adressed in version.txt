3.1.0.6 > It errored, not sure why you keep changing location of files, but I'm going to purposefully change things up. So we know where things are at. here is the most up to date 5.1.0.5 with current build_exe issue to be resolved. Replace "Kenpo_Vocabulary_Study_Flashcards.ico" with "Advanced Flashcards WebApp Server Icon.png" logo .icon rename and whatever to this location; \static\res\webappservericons\, create icons needed for exe build here, dont touch webapp browser icon and other webserver project synced images leave the way they are, next sync will fix it. kenpo_words.json is located in KenpoFlashcardsWebServer_Packaged\data\. version.json, like it always has been, is located in \root(KenpoFlashcardsWebServer_Packaged)\ update to new step 5 version 3.1.0.6 v11, while updating readme and changelog and version.json and Version-WebServerPackaged-v3.1.0.5 v11.txt
