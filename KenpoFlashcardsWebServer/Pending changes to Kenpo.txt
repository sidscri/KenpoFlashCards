If breakdawn data is present I want a small icon on all cards with data to show it present. Maybe under the Status: or definition on definition page. With a quick view if pressed with auto closing.

"Saved breakdown" text below "Select group..." dropdown does not change on changing cards

Dont change color (white background, light grey text) of study/group dropdown list when changing from a group, cant see options.

As admin to see who is actively/recently logged in and studying

Notes to be added to cards, to view if selected.  Option to share and collaberate with others.



Next thing is to add png image and to change the color a little to match the company colors 

and to have an icon for it to show with the other apps running in the background i.e. wifi, bluetooth, Windows security, etc.

Run as service

Turn this back into github to re-build the android app APK

KenpoFlashCardsAndroidApp.zip with data, design, features from KenpoFlashcardsWeb.zip.  So I may create a better version of the KenpoFlashcardsProject android app
