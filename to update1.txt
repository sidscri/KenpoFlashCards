I want to add in make3_zip_KenpoFlashcardsWebServer_Packaged-Zip.bat if version.json contains "webserver_version": "8.0.2",
  "webserver_build": 47, and _ws%webserver_version%-%webserver_build% to the zip


As suggested, please create a migration checklist.  Now that both ends apps are working well together I need a tool to push updates to android app in the future.

I want kenpo and spanish to be owned by sidscri, only kenpo to have built-in flagged, spanish will just be as it is a user created deck that no other user can access, unless I give it to them as an admin. Where did the the edit decks button go on spanish, guess it didnt show since I couldnt make me the owner.  Same goes for built-in settings and user deck access, no decks are showing up in drop downs.  &&Fix1.png, fix2.png&&

admin force of password refresh for john smith, he logged in using 123456789, but it did not ask for a force a password change, before logging in.

In "Create New Deck" section I want a method of adding cards to be added right below Description.  After creating a new deck and with that option selected it will go to that methods page ie. Keyword, Photo, Document.  If keyword is chosen it will auto search for max of 25 cards using deck name and description., the other methods will open thier photo or document upload window. Once added, I want the search keyword cleared and max cards to default to 25. I noticed after sucessfully adding 51 state capitals, the Search keywords and max cards persisted.

In Admin>System page>"server information"> application says undifined, "version" is 4.0.0 (build 12), Release is -

verifi tht logs can be made to show in Admin>logs page>"server logs"> App Logs, Error Logs, User Activity (only logs)

In admin>overview>"Total Users" to show general info about the users, >"Study Deck" to show all decks and their info.  For those and the other >"Total Cards", >"Breakdowns" lets make it a fun experience to look at when clicked on.


##tool##
Wish the new updated KenpoFlashcardsWebServer_Packaged changelog and readme more closely resembled the add, fix, changes, simular to whats in the KenpoFlashcardsWebServer changelogs add, fix, changes.

##Package##
Old icons are still showing up in desktop shortcut(in properties the new are in change icon) and showing in task manager processes &&fix.3.png&&

Why are there always two processes running of the same name.




I unistalled the program but nothing got uninstalled, the service is still running. tray still present, desktop shortcut still there, still shows up in recently added in start, still shows in program files, but 

Add an auto backup of data folder to %local_user%\...\DataBackups\"Data_Auto_%Date%_%Appversion%\data".zip\ Changes on demand, keeping last 10 per user to be restored, another setting for auto backup: off>every 30min>1 hour>2 hours>6 hours(default)>1 Day>2 days.

Windows icon changes: Create a dedicated location for Icons and logos in KenpoFlashcardsWebServer_Packaged\static\res\webappservericons\. Create new app icon files using the "Advanced Flashcards WebApp Server Icon.png" photo to remap all current kenpo icons that show on a windows system, tray, desktop, add remove programs list, etc. Dont touch any that are being used by the web app in browser or the original windows server project. I will sync those updates later after editing on webserver project. 


----Webserver----
I want kenpo_words.json to live and get mapped from KenpoFlashcardsProject-v2\app\src\main\assets\ to KenpoFlashcardsWebServer\data\ instead  That means KenpoFlashcardsProject needs to also change its grab to KenpoFlashcardsWebServer\data\ if appicable

Change "Kenpo Flashcards" to "Advanced Flashcards"; "Study Flashcards" to "Advanced Flashcards", except for ("Study Flashcards" {Name of current Deck} "Cards loaded: 89") on main pages. Keep as it is.

Other users non built-in decks should not be available by default on new or other profiles.  Sidscri created Basic Spanish Words..., only sidscri should have it in his deck, unless admined to any specific user.

Add a save current Custom Deck to Custom deck saves page, make sure there is a way to chose a saved deck to study when desired, in Custom Set Settings the random number field is still ontop of Add random button, field needs to be way shorter.  Rename "Add Random" to "Add Random Cards"

Change WebApp icon, Now that the apps name has changed to "Advanced Flashcards WebApp Server"

"Invite codes" section No Decks appear in "Select deck..." list. same goes for "User Deck Access"

In "User Deck Access" section, when a user is selected, i.e Sidscri (admin), Built-in is enabled, so only disable option should be avaialble, not sure which one is currently active or not. In this current case no deck is selected, both options should be unavailable.

In "Built-In Deck Management", there isnt a way to add built-in decks by default, there is a "Remove Built-In" button on kenpo (which is great), but how to re-add kenpo if "Remove Built-In" button is pressed on kenpo.



****DONE****

If successfully pulled from "\%appdataLocal%\Advanced Flashcards WebApp Server\data\", backup current "\root\data\" to "\sidscri-apps\DataBackups\"WebServer_Packaged_Data_%Date%\data".zip\" then replace current "\root\data\" with "\packaging\build_data\" data.  Doing this will keep the next package being built updated with the most up-to-date data, in case it gets installed on a new device. If there isnt \Advanced Flashcards WebApp Server\data folder in %local_user%, which normally means its a fresh install, than skip and use "\root\data\" instead of "\packaging\build_data\".   

Verify when "\packaging\build_data\" is present that "2. build_exe.bat" is pulling from "\packaging\build_data\" when "\packaging\build_data\" files are newer than "\root\data\"., if "\packaging\build_data\" isnt there than default to "\root\data\" Any overwrites needs to be backed up first. Log the upgrade or installed version to version, files touched, files skipped, files replaced, etc in both sidscri-apps\logs\Install\updates<or>installs\log to have pc>user>version>dates and "\%appdataLocal%\Advanced Flashcards WebApp Server\data\logs\log to have version>dates"


still needs to after build backup "\sidscri-apps\KenpoFlashcardsWebServer_Packaged\data" and Replace with newer data in KenpoFlashcardsWebServer_Packaged\packaging\build_data\ flagged as being pulled from "C:\Users\Sidscri\AppData\Local\Advanced Flashcards WebApp Server\data".

Change log location in Local\Advanced Flashcards WebApp Server\data\log\ to existing \root\log\ folder

Need a flag to let builder know that data was pulled from Appdatalocal into build_data so build_data will be used in a new install, if flag is negative then use packaged data folder.

During update of app to PC, existing data files win over unpackaged data files. if there is a way to know which specific file is newer and better, than override, but backup data to %local_user%\...\DataBackups\"Data_Updated_%Date%_%Appversion%\data".zip\

deck image feature: I will want an option to add images to study decks as an option when creating or editing decks. For Kenpo, I want "Kenpo Vovabulary Study Flashcards.png" used as its logo on main page as pictured and by default without adding optional image, use "Advanced Flashcards logo.png".

When i refresh page it always changes back to kenpo with kenpo image.  I dont think default deck actually makes defaulted deck stay default after refresh.
