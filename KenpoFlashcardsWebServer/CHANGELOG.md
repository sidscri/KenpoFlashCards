# Changelog — Advanced Flashcards WebAppServer (formerly KenpoFlashcardsWebServer)

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is simple and practical:
- **Added**: new user-facing features
- **Changed**: behavior changes, refactors
- **Fixed**: bug fixes
- **Security**: auth/permissions/security changes

---

## Unreleased
- (Add changes here as you work. Move them into a release when you publish.)

---

## 8.0.1 (build 46) — 2026-01-27

### Fixed
- **Deck header logos** now render correctly on the Study page (missing header `<img>` elements prevented any logo from showing).
- Logo refresh now runs on initial load and when switching/loading decks.
- Decks with no assigned logo now fall back to `/res/decklogos/advanced_flashcards_logo.png` (instead of any Kenpo-specific default).

---

## 8.0.0 (build 45) — 2026-01-27

### Added
- **Major rebrand**: internal project name is now **Advanced Flashcards WebAppServer**; browser UI branding is **Advanced Flashcards WebApp** (no user-visible “Server”).
- **WebApp icons**: new dedicated path `static/res/webappicons/` with updated favicon / browser tab icon using the Advanced Flashcards logo.
- **Deck logos (optional)**: support for per-deck logos with default fallback to the Advanced Flashcards logo; Kenpo deck uses its own logo.

### Changed
- Updated user-facing text from “Kenpo Flashcards” → “Advanced Flashcards WebApp” across the Web UI (while keeping the main Study page header line `Study Flashcards • {Deck} • Cards loaded: {#}` unchanged).
